# README

This is a React on Rails project, where I am using a Rails API as the backend server, and React (with create-react-app) as the frontend server.  

It was original a short tutorial from a YouTube video, then I since modernized by converting the React code to follow the new React Hooks standard which uses function based components in place of class based components.



This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
